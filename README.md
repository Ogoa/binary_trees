### Overview
The binary tree is a non-linear abstract data structure that contains nodes arranged in a hierarchical manner where each node can have a maximum of two children.<br>
Traversal of a binary tree can be done in three ways:
- In-order: left -> root -> right
- Pre-order: root -> left -> right
- Post-order: left -> right -> root
